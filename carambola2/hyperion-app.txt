Control you LED strip from your mobile phone
--------------------------------------------

The android app hyperion free implements a color chooser.
Its main screen features three widgets:
 - a wheel with color hue, 
 - a slider for saturation
 - a slider for value.

Its settings screen accepts an IP-address and a port number to connect to.
The connection is TCP, and after each command, a response is expected, 
but the contents of the response is ignored.

Commands are JSON formatted, and terminated by newline. The response format
is irrelevant, the terminating newline is important.

Example commands sent by the app:

{"command":"serverinfo"}

{"command":"color","priority":99,"color":[0,2,255]}

{"command":"color","priority":99,"color":[255,232,110],"duration":14400000}

{"command":"clearall"}
