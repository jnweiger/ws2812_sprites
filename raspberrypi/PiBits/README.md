Here you'll find various RaspberryPi related projcts:

ServoBlaster:  A kernel driver that lets you control 8 (or more) servos from your RaspberryPi.

Panalyzer:     A Pi based Logic Analyzer.  This can be found in a separate repository alongside this one, but is mentioned here for completeness.

PiFmDma:       A Version of the FM Transmitter software that uses DMA for improved quality and much reduced CPU load.  NOTE: Do not use this code unless you understand what it does, what FM frequencies it might interfere with, what is and is not legal in your country, etc.

MouseScan:     Code to turn the sensor in an optical mouse in to a very crude
               hand held scanner.
